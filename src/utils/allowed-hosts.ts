 * it is a bind directive, not an address a client resolves, so accepting it
 * would let any caller satisfy the allowlist by sending "Host: 0.0.0.0:<port>"
 * — a value that is public knowledge rather than a property of the deployment.
 * That would defeat the guard exactly where it matters most, since binding to
 * all interfaces is what makes the server reachable off-host in the first

 * Deployments that bind to all interfaces and need to accept a real hostname
 * (a Kubernetes Service DNS name, an ingress host) set
 * DNS_REBINDING_ALLOWED_HOST to that name; it replaces this list entirely.
